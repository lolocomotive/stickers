## Data Collection and Use

This application is designed with your privacy as a priority. For its core functionality, the application **does not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information from you.** The stickers you create are stored locally on your device and are not transmitted to us or any third party by this application.

By default, the app operates completely offline. Data is only transmitted to third-party services if you choose to use specific, optional features as described below.

## Third-Party Services

Our Service may offer optional features that utilize third-party services, which may collect information used to identify you. You can use the core functionality of our app without ever using these services.

### 1. Google Fonts (Optional Feature)

This feature allows you to download new fonts to customize your stickers. **Using this feature is entirely optional. If you do not browse or download fonts, no connection to Google Fonts is ever made.**

* **Purpose:** To provide you with a wide variety of fonts for creating your stickers, our application can download font files from the Google Fonts servers **at your request**.
* **Data Transmitted:** **Only if and when you choose to browse or download a font**, your device sends a request to Google's servers. This request technically requires the transmission of data, which typically includes your **IP address**, the requested font, and technical information about your device (e.g., User-Agent string).
* **Provider's Policy:** We do not control how Google processes this data. This data transfer is necessary to provide the font-downloading feature. For more information on how Google handles your data, please review Google's Privacy Policy:
    * [Google fonts Privacy and Data Collection](https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq/privacy)

### 2. Google Play Services (Conditional)

**This section only applies if you have downloaded and installed this application from the Google Play Store.** If you obtained this application from another source (e.g., by downloading the APK directly), this section is not applicable, as Google Play Services are not required for the app's functionality.

* **Purpose:** The Google Play Store uses Google Play Services to function. These services may collect data for security, analytics, and to manage your purchases and updates.
* **Provider's Policy:** We do not have access to or control over the data collected by Google Play Services. For more details, please see the privacy policy for Google Play Services:
    * [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
